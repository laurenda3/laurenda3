# Laurenda Landry

**ServiceNow Developer | Process Automation & Integration Specialist**

I design and build ServiceNow solutions that replace manual, error-prone processes with automated, auditable systems. My work focuses on custom application development, workflow automation, and platform integrations that solve real operational problems—not demo-only ticketing scenarios.

My background in operations, compliance, and IT support informs a practical engineering mindset: every solution is designed to be usable, scalable, and defensible in a real business environment.
